Conversion timeline for estimates

For the following time:
	started development: Wed Dec  22 19:22:00 CST 2016+false
	ended development: Wed Dec  22 20:03:00 CST 2016+false
It took me that long to convert 1 page over  from the webpack-dev-server to a express.js webserver (application.html -> application.jade which is ~50 LOC)
